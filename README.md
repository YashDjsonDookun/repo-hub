# repo-hub

### Like I once said:

> I AM LAZY ~Djson ðŸ˜’

ðŸ¤¡ This script requires both **_git_** and **_hub_** to be installed on your machines.
(You're expected to know how it's done, Not gonna explain...)

ðŸ¤¡ And of course, you're expected to have python3 installed too!

ðŸ¤¡ You'll also need to add the script to your **_PATH_** for this to work everywhere.
(Figure this out too)

### What does it do?
    -   provides the ability to create a remote repository within the current directory and push to it
    -   provides the ability to push to the existing remote repository within the current directory
(current directory here means the project directory that you are working on)

### Usage For Windows Users:
~~~
    Add exe to PATH and execute command from desired directory
    
    Commands:
        repo-hub -h or --help for any help
        repo-hub -c repo or --create repo to create new repository and push to it
        repo-hub -p  <"Commit Message"> or --push <"Commit Message"> to push to current remote repository
~~~
<<<<<<< HEAD

### What I'll Probably add in the future:
- [ ] pull requests
- [ ] support for branches (create and push)
- [ ] merge
